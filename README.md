# Java Academy Pro (Middle - Senior)

Version: **1.1**

Welcome to <i>JAcademy Pro</i>, an educational initiative designed to update software engineers' skills and knowledge
in order to enhance their ability to design and develop programs efficiently.
This program covers a wide range of programming topics, each featuring a brief explanation of a common challenge and
effective solutions to help you overcome it.

## Cloud Native Java

Cloud native computing is an approach in software development that utilizes cloud computing to "build and run scalable
applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds".
These technologies such as containers, microservices, serverless functions, cloud native processors and immutable
infrastructure, deployed via declarative code are common elements of this architectural style.
Cloud native technologies focus on minimizing users' operational burden.
